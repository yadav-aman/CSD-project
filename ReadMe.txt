 A Brief Summary of Project (A pdf file containing a description of your project mentioning what all features/functions 
 you have implemented along with all the data structures that you have used in your project)

About Our Project-
We have created a voting system that can automatically count the number of votes after the election.

Features and Functions of the project-
1. Our program can read data from CSV file and can create the required data structure in the computer’s memory.
2. Our program makes sure that no one can vote twice.
3. Searching of user’s data can be done in O(log N) time.

Data structures used -
We have used the linked list data structure to store the data of political parties, and as we know that the numbers 
of voters can be of the significant amount so we have used the Height Balanced binary tree known as AVL tree to store the 
voters’ information this makes searching easy.

Steps Required for successful execution -
1. Make sure that the code is compiled and executed in windows environment.
2. Make sure all the necessary files are placed in the same folder. There are total 5 files named "main.c", "header.h",
"ReadMe.txt", "CandidateList.csv", "VoterList.csv".
3. To Run code open main.c in code blocks and click on build and run.
4. Follow on screen procedures given in the program.
5. After the Elections one more file named "Results.txt" will be created in which the results of the election will be saved.
