# About project

So this is a simple C project that me and my team made for our end term CSD-201 submission.
In this project we have implemented **String processing, File Handling, AVL trees and Linked List**, for more information you can refer to this <a href="https://github.com/yadav-aman/CSD-project/blob/master/Pamphlet%20(except%20steps%20for%20execution).pdf">pdf</a>.

### Steps Required for successful execution -

1. Make sure that the code is compiled and executed in windows environment.

2. Make sure all the necessary files are placed in the same folder. There are total 6 files named "main.c", "header.h",
   "ReadMe.txt", "CandidateList.csv", "VoterList.csv" , "Pamphlet.pdf".

3. To Run code open main.c in code blocks and click on build and run.

4. Follow on screen procedures given in the program.

5. Refer to the VoterList.csv file for details of the voters to cast a vote.
   Sample:
   Voter ID: 827892

6. To see the results of the election, voting should be closed first. For this, go to the admin panel. 
   Note - admin ID is 123456

7. After seeing the results, head to the main menu to exit the program. 

8. The results are also saved in a "Results.txt" file and can be seen even after exiting the program.
